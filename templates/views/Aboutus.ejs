                 <h2>Our success stories</h2>
                 <p>The Corona pandemic has certainly altered the way we lead our lives. However, it is people who require regular blood traRana Ghoshnsfusions such as Thalassemics & others who are struggling the most to cope with this sea change. Indian Red Cross  is leaving no stone unturned to ensure those in need have unhindered access to safe blood, even in the remotest corners of the country. Rana Ghosh, an eight year old is a Thalassemic and a resident of Karuigachhi, a remote area in Tehatta, West Bengal</p>
                 <p> During the lockdown, Rana's Hemoglobin dropped sharply below 4, leaving his family sleepless & worried. What made matters worse was the uncertainty of finding blood donors in the lockdown period. On being approached by the boy's family, IRCS immediately reached out to all voluntary blood donors in a bid to motivate them to step forward when it mattered the most & save a child's life.</p>
                 <p>The relentless efforts of Red Cross volunteers helped facilitate Rana's urgent transfusion   on time, thanks to the generosity of 2 blood donors- Sh. Shubha Roy Chowdhury from       Chatarpara and Sh. Biplab  Donor Tehatta 2 Sarkar from Debnathpur who readily agreed to donate blood at   Tehatta Blood Bank. Today, Rana is fit and healthy and gets his   regular transfusions   done without any difficulty, thanks to the real heroes   of the corona crisis.</p>
